# Solutions — Resume Plan (handoff for a new session)

Date: 2026-06-05
Worktree: `/home/jack/GitHub/bifrost/.claude/worktrees/solutions-success-criteria`
Branch: `worktree-solutions-success-criteria`  •  Draft PR: **#347** (experimental — do NOT merge)
Spec: `docs/plans/2026-06-04-solutions-success-criteria.md` (see §8 "REAL STATUS")

## The loop (the bar to clear)
Fix findings → TDD each → local verify → **full Codex spec review** → repeat until
**two CONSECUTIVE full Codex reviews come back with ZERO P1/P2 spec findings**. Only then is
it worth human QA. (User directive: 2 clean reviews; reuse `ManifestResolver`/indexers so future
fields can't create deploy gaps — done for forms/agents.)

## How to run Codex review (the gate)
```bash
cd <worktree>
codex review - < /tmp/codex_review3.txt   # prompt file already written; or rebuild from the one below
```
Triage with `superpowers:receiving-code-review` — VERIFY each finding against the code before fixing
(several past findings were right; some I over-asserted in tests). The prompt that found the deep
issues is saved at `/tmp/codex_spec_review_prompt.txt` (+ `/tmp/codex_review3.txt` with the "what's
fixed" context). Re-create it if /tmp is cleared — it's a "full adversarial spec review, file:line +
severity, hunt for issues the fixes introduced."

## IN-FLIGHT right now
- **Codex review #3 is running in the background** → output at `/tmp/codex_review3_out.txt`.
  Read its final `^codex$` block first thing. It re-reviews all batch-2 fixes + hunts new issues.
- Tree is CLEAN (an incomplete P2-j edit was reverted — see below).

## DONE this session (all committed, each with a test)
Original Codex spec review found 7 (G1–G7); a re-review found 10 more (batch 2). Fixed:
- **G1** deployed entities visible in `list()` (filter moved to name-cascade get(), opt-in via
  `exclude_solution_managed`/`include_solution_managed` flags).
- **G2** forms + agents deploy — **via canonical FormIndexer/AgentIndexer** (full content, gap-proof).
- **G3** per-install app identity — migration `20260605_app_identity` (partial unique indexes).
- **G4** git-sync `read_workspace_bundle` bundles apps + forms + agents.
- **G5** ambiguous org-scoped deploy refused (`_resolve_target_install`).
- **G6** cross-solution `sys.modules` eviction in `_clear_workspace_modules`.
- **batch2 P1-a** role-centric endpoints `/api/roles/{id}/{workflows,apps,forms,agents}` (assign,
  remove, bulk-unassign — 12 endpoints) now guard managed entities.
- **batch2 P1-b** app-by-slug open path passes `include_solution_managed=True`.
- **batch2 P1-c** deploy marks apps published (`published_snapshot`+`published_at`).
- **batch2 P1-d** bundle-manifest returns `app_model` for `standalone_v2` BEFORE the v1 build.
- **batch2 P1-e** **DB-first deploy** — all DB upserts/reconcile run before ANY S3 write; app builds +
  stale-dist deletes deferred to an S3 phase that runs only after DB succeeds.
- **batch2 P1-f** form fields read from `form_schema.fields` (was wrong key; old test passed falsely).
- **batch2 P1-g** only `standalone_v2` apps are vite-built (inline_v1 would fail a Vite build).
- **batch2 P2-h** agent tool/delegation/knowledge bindings deploy (via indexer).
- **batch2 P2-i** full workflow metadata deployed (endpoint/timeout/category/tags, full-replace).

## REMAINING (do these next, then re-run Codex until 2 clean)
1. **P2-j — binary app assets dropped.** `_collect_apps` (api/bifrost/commands/solution.py:167)
   only collects `_APP_SRC_SUFFIXES` (text); png/woff/etc. are skipped → server build emits a dist
   with missing assets. **Half-done edit was reverted** — redo cleanly:
   - In `_collect_apps`: `import base64` (top of file); collect non-text files into a `bin_files`
     dict as `{rel: base64(bytes)}`; add `"bin_files": bin_files` to each entry. Skip `.DS_Store`.
   - Thread `bin_files` through: `SolutionDeployRequest.apps` already free-form dict;
     `_run_app_builds` (deploy.py) must decode `bin_files` (base64→bytes) and merge into `src_bytes`
     before `builder.build(...)`. Also collect them in `git_sync._collect_apps` reuse path.
   - Test: an app dir with a `.png` deploys and the bytes reach the builder.
2. **G7 (P2) — v2 app route.** The v2 iframe loads `/api/applications/{id}/dist/index.html`, so the
   inner app's `window.location` is the dist URL and `<BrowserRouter basename='/apps/{slug}'>`
   won't match → deep-links differ from a normal app (criterion 12 / spec §2). This is a DESIGN
   FORK — needs a decision: (a) serve dist as a document AT `/apps/{slug}` (nginx/backend route work
   so window.location matches), (b) scaffold uses a pathname-independent router, or (c) accept
   iframe-at-dist + document the limitation. Recommend deciding with the user. Also: the
   BundledAppShell v2 branch (client/src/components/jsx-app/BundledAppShell.tsx) builds the iframe
   src from the dist route — align with whatever serving decision is made. The vite `--base` is set
   to `/api/applications/{id}/dist/` in app_build.py `_run_vite_build`.
3. Anything Codex #3 (and subsequent reviews) surface.

## KEY FILES
- `api/src/services/solutions/deploy.py` — the deployer (DB-first phases; `_upsert_*`, `_run_app_builds`,
  `_delete_stale_app_dist`, `_reconcile_*`). Forms/agents delegate to indexers.
- `api/src/services/solutions/git_sync.py` — connected auto-pull bundle (`read_workspace_bundle`).
- `api/src/repositories/org_scoped.py` — `get()`/`can_access()`/`_apply_cascade_scope()` +
  `include_solution_managed`/`exclude_solution_managed` flags (the visibility model — read carefully).
- `api/src/routers/roles.py` — the 12 now-guarded role-junction endpoints.
- `api/src/routers/app_code_files.py` — bundle-manifest v2 short-circuit; dist serve route; S3 file guards.
- `api/bifrost/commands/solution.py` — CLI deploy + `_collect_*` (P2-j lives here).
- `api/src/services/file_storage/indexers/{form,agent}.py` — canonical content indexers deploy reuses.
- `api/src/services/manifest_import.py` — `_form_content_from_manifest`, `_agent_content_from_manifest`.

```
Migrations: a new one landed (`20260605_app_identity`). `./test.sh stack reset` applies it to the
test template. For the debug stack: restart bifrost-init then api (see CLAUDE.md).

## LIVE DEBUG (for hands-on / browser)
- Debug stack was UP in **port mode** at `http://localhost:37791` (login dev@gobifrost.com/password).
  Netbird mode can't be browser-driven (Vite HMR hang) — to force port mode, the user's
  `~/.config/bifrost/debug.env` sets NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY; temporarily move it aside, `./debug.sh up`,
  then restore it. (It was restored at end of session; re-do if you need the browser.)
- Scratch CLI: `/tmp/bifrost-cli-sol/.venv/bin/bifrost` (API-matched, logged in). Sample solution
  workspace at `/tmp/bifrost-cli-sol/v2sol/`. Manual Playwright harnesses:
  `cd client && TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:<port> npx playwright test -c playwright.manual.config.ts`
- Local git-connected testing pattern: a bare repo INSIDE the api container
  (`git init --bare /tmp/livegitrepo`), connected install `git_repo_url=file:///tmp/livegitrepo`,
  then `POST /api/solutions/{id}/sync`. Set `git config --system --add safe.directory '*'` in the
  container first (else "dubious ownership" — a `file://`-local-only quirk, not a prod concern).

## DONE-BAR REMINDER
Do NOT claim "done" again until two consecutive full Codex reviews are clean (zero P1/P2). I've been
wrong about "done" three times — each review found real depth. Trust the gate, not optimism.
