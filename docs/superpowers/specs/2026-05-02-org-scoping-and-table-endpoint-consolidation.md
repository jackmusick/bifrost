# Org Scoping (As Implemented) + Table-Document Endpoint Consolidation

> **Status:** Design document. Documents how scoping currently works (citing the code), names what diverges from intent, and recommends a focused fix list. The substantive change is consolidating two parallel table-document endpoint paths.

## How scoping works today

### The intended rule

Every authenticated request from outside the engine gets scoped to the caller's organization, with cross-org targeting allowed only for **provider-org members** (`Organization.is_provider == True`, well-known UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002` from `api/alembic/versions/20260107_022300_add_provider_org.py:26`). Provider members can pass `?scope=<other-org-uuid>` or `?scope=global`; everyone else has scope ignored — they're pinned to their own org.

The intended rule is expressed correctly in two places:

- `api/bifrost/_execution_context.py:148-167` (`ExecutionContext.set_scope`) — gates on `self.organization.is_provider`.
- `api/bifrost/_context.py:128-147` (`resolve_scope`) — gates on `context.organization.is_provider`.

Both are SDK-runtime checks that fire before the SDK issues an HTTP request.

### How the API enforces it (today)

The server-side gate is `is_superuser`, not `is_provider`. Two helpers:

- `api/src/core/org_filter.py:91-139` (`resolve_target_org`) — for write paths. Superusers can target any org via scope; non-superusers' scope is ignored, pinned to `user.organization_id`.
- `api/src/core/org_filter.py:28-89` (`resolve_org_filter`) — for read/list paths. Returns a `(filter_type, org_id)` for `OrgScopedRepository` to use.

Both gate on `is_superuser`. The intended `is_provider` rule and the actual `is_superuser` rule correlate today only because of migration history: `api/alembic/versions/20260107_022300_add_provider_org.py:53-66` swept all PLATFORM-type users into the provider org. That correlation is brittle; we don't fix it here (see "Out of scope" below) but it's worth knowing the rule the helpers implement isn't the rule the SDK enforces.

### Inside the engine

Workflows run as a synthetic engine superuser (`ENGINE_USER_ID = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, `is_superuser=true`, no org). See `api/src/core/security.py:405-449` (`authenticate_engine`). The worker mints this token at the start of every execution and saves it to `~/.bifrost/credentials.json`; the SDK uses it as the bearer for every HTTP call back to the API.

The engine identity is intentional and stays as-is: the engine is a controlled environment, an admin wrote the workflow, and the engine has the authority to do what the workflow needs to do.

### How the resolved org is computed for a workflow

The rule is "workflow's org if set, else caller's org," and it's implemented **twice**:

- `api/src/routers/workflows.py:807-832` — the API handler computes `execution_org_id` for the queued execution. It checks (in order): explicit `request.org_id` override (admin only, line 814), workflow's `organization_id` (line 818), then caller's `ctx.org_id` (line 824) with a `DeveloperContext.default_org_id` lookup for platform admins (lines 826-832).
- `api/src/jobs/consumers/workflow_execution.py:540-549` — the worker dispatch consumer re-derives the same value when it fetches `workflow_data.get("organization_id")`. It overrides `org_id` if the workflow is org-scoped, leaves the caller's org if global.

The first computed value flows through `_publish_pending` (`api/src/services/execution/async_executor.py:33-89`) into the Redis pending blob (`pending["org_id"]`), which the worker then reads and clobbers with its own re-derivation. The duplication is wasteful but currently consistent: both sites apply the same rule. If the rule changes, both have to change in lockstep.

The worker's `org_data` (`api/src/jobs/consumers/workflow_execution.py:633-647`) is fetched via `ConfigResolver.get_organization` and **does include `is_provider`**. The API handler's intermediate `Organization(id=..., name="", is_active=True)` (`api/src/routers/workflows.py:867`) does **not** populate `is_provider`. Since the API-handler version is throwaway (the worker re-fetches), this discrepancy doesn't bite at runtime — but it's still a footgun: if someone refactors away the worker re-fetch, the `is_provider` check in `set_scope`/`resolve_scope` silently breaks.

### What the worker passes to the SDK runtime

The worker reconstructs `ExecutionContext` from the Redis pending blob plus the org-data dict, in `api/src/services/execution/worker.py:140-160`. `Organization` carries `is_provider` correctly here (line 150). `ExecutionContext.organization` is what `set_scope`/`resolve_scope` evaluate against. So inside the SDK runtime, the `is_provider` rule works correctly.

The HTTP request the SDK makes back to the API does **not** carry the caller or the resolved org. It carries the engine-superuser token. The API server therefore evaluates every workflow-driven request as engine-superuser.

This is intentional. Per the user's framing: the engine is a controlled environment where workflow authors are trusted, the engine identity is what the API sees, and the API enforces nothing about the caller for engine-attested calls. We're not changing that.

### Where the rule isn't enforced server-side

`api/src/routers/cli.py:357-392` (`_get_cli_org_id`) is the CLI-side scope resolver. It enforces nothing — whatever scope arrives on the wire is honored, with no UUID validation and no permission check. Used by every endpoint under `/api/cli/...`.

Inside workflow runtime this is invisible because the SDK gates `set_scope` and `resolve_scope` before issuing the request. But from outside the engine — a developer running `bifrost.tables.insert(scope=...)` against a deployed API after `bifrost login`, or anyone with a regular user JWT making a direct HTTP call to a `/api/cli/...` endpoint — `_get_cli_org_id` lets them target any org with no check.

This is a real bypass. It exists because most `/api/cli/...` endpoints (configs, integrations management, knowledge mutation, AI completion) were genuinely intended for engine-only use — the rule wasn't enforced because the endpoints weren't supposed to be reachable by users with motivations to exploit the gap. That assumption was always shaky and is no longer true: the table-document handlers under `/api/cli/...` (the ones we're consolidating) overlap with the REST surface, so they're effectively reachable.

## Table-document endpoint duplication

Two parallel implementations exist:

- `api/src/routers/cli.py:2818-3370` — 10 CLI handlers for `/api/cli/tables/documents/{insert, upsert, get, update, delete, insert/batch, upsert/batch, delete/batch, query, count}`.
- `api/src/routers/tables.py:782-1170` — REST handlers for `/api/tables/{table_id}/documents/{insert, get, update, delete, query, count, batch, batch-delete}`.

Side-by-side behavior:

| Behavior | CLI | REST |
|---|---|---|
| Auth gate | `_get_cli_org_id` (no check) | `_resolve_target_org_safe` via `get_table_or_404` (`is_superuser` check) |
| Table identifier | name (`request.table`), name + `app` filter | name or UUID (via `get_table_or_404`) |
| Auto-create on insert | yes — `_find_or_create_table_for_sdk` (cli.py:2657) | no — 404 if table missing |
| `application_id` lookup filter | yes — `request.app` filters by `Table.application_id` (cli.py:2625) | no — `application_id` is a column on the table, not a lookup axis |
| Policy check (`_check_action_or_403`) | **none** | yes — read/create/update/delete all gated (tables.py:798, 858, 886, 914, 953) |
| WS publish (`publish_document_change`) | **none** | yes — insert/update/delete (tables.py:828, 876, 932) |
| Read filter via `compile_read_filter` | **none** | yes — query/count return empty when no rule grants read (tables.py:855, 988) |
| Audit on policy denial | **none** | (planned; not yet shipped per `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-01-table-policies-hardening.md`) |
| `created_by` / `updated_by` override in body | yes — `request.created_by`, `request.updated_by` honored | no — always `ctx.user.user_id` |
| Update merge semantics | `{**doc.data, **request.data}` (cli.py:3024) | repo-level merge via `DocumentRepository.update` |
| Upsert idempotency | atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` (cli.py:2918) | not exposed as a separate verb; `batch` accepts `upsert: bool` (tables.py:1014) |
| Batch policy check | no | yes — pre-flight all rows, return 403 with denied indices (tables.py:1037, 1135) |
| Returns a `table_id` for downstream subscribe | no — returns `id, table_id, data, created_at, updated_at` per doc | yes — `DocumentListResponse.table_id: UUID` in query response (tables.py:1003) |

What CLI does that REST doesn't:

1. **Auto-create on insert.** Workflow authors can call `tables.insert("foo", {...})` without an explicit create, and the table is materialized on first write with `make_seed_admin_bypass()` policies. This is real ergonomic value.
2. **`app` lookup filter.** Same table name in different apps within the same org resolves differently depending on the SDK caller's `app` argument. Used by the SDK (`api/bifrost/tables.py:178+`).
3. **`created_by` / `updated_by` body override.** CLI handlers accept these in the body and use them; REST always uses the calling user.
4. **Atomic upsert as a single verb.** REST has it via `batch` with `upsert=true`, not as a single-doc operation.

What REST does that CLI doesn't:

1. **Policy enforcement.** Every action goes through `_check_action_or_403` or `compile_read_filter`. CLI doesn't invoke either.
2. **WebSocket publish.** Every mutation publishes a `document_change` event for live subscribers. CLI doesn't.
3. **All-or-nothing batch denials.** Batch endpoints pre-flight every row against policy and return 403 with the full set of denied indices. CLI batch handlers just commit.
4. **Read filter from policies.** Query and count return empty (not 403) when no rule grants read, avoiding existence leaks.

## What to consolidate

The duplication isn't justified. Reasons to keep CLI handlers:

- **Auto-create on insert** — real ergonomic; doesn't have to live on the API. Move it to the SDK as a 404→create→retry. The SDK already issues `POST /api/tables` for explicit creates (api/bifrost/tables.py:89). On `INSERT` returning 404 from the REST endpoint, post a create with the same name, then retry the insert. Race resolution via the existing 409-on-create-conflict path.

- **`app` lookup filter** — the SDK already passes `app` through. Either teach the REST `get_table_or_404` to accept an `app` query param (small change), or scope the SDK lookup by `app` client-side (issue a `GET /api/tables` filtered by `application_id` first, then issue the document op against the resolved UUID). Server-side via `?app=<uuid>` is simpler.

- **`created_by` / `updated_by` body override** — this exists because CLI handlers run as engine-superuser and the workflow author wanted to attribute writes to "alice" rather than "engine@bifrost.internal". After consolidation, REST handlers will receive engine-superuser as the user (since the engine token still hits the wire). If we want attribution to differ from the connected user, REST needs to accept the override too. **Decision required:** either (a) add `created_by` / `updated_by` to the REST `DocumentCreate` / `DocumentUpdate` bodies and accept them when the caller is engine-attested, or (b) accept that consolidated writes from workflows will be attributed to the engine. (a) preserves current behavior; (b) is a behavior change.

- **Atomic upsert as a single verb** — the SDK gets one round trip vs two for upserts. Not strictly necessary but worth keeping. We can add `POST /api/tables/{id}/documents/upsert` to REST as an explicit verb, or use `batch` with one doc. The SDK is the only caller; it can do whichever is more convenient.

Reasons to drop CLI handlers:

- **Policy enforcement.** Not even debatable — the policy hardening branch this design lives on shipped policy support specifically because tables are now user-facing. SDK callers (workflows) get the same guarantee web UI callers get.
- **WS publish.** Visible bug today: workflow inserts don't show up live in the UI. Demo POC at `/tmp/bifrost-poc/` documented this in the prior session.
- **Audit.** Same reason — engine-attributed denials aren't useful, but only because engine-attributed everything is the bug. Once engine writes go through the policy gate, audit becomes meaningful.

The consolidation: **delete the 10 CLI handlers; point the Python SDK at `/api/tables/{name_or_id}/documents/*` (which already accepts name-or-UUID via `get_table_or_404`). Move auto-create into the SDK. Add `?app=<uuid>` to the REST table-lookup helpers. Decide on `created_by` override.**

After consolidation, web UI and Python SDK share one endpoint set, policy enforcement / WS publish / audit are uniform, and the no-server-gate `_get_cli_org_id` stops being part of the table-document path. (`_get_cli_org_id` itself stays for the surviving `/api/cli/*` endpoints — fixing it is a separate, smaller question handled below.)

## Other fixes in scope

These are all small and follow from the analysis:

1. **`_get_cli_org_id` validation.** Validate `scope` as UUID (or `"global"`, or null); 422 on garbage. The function currently returns garbage strings unmodified (cli.py:381) and the failure mode is a downstream PostgreSQL type error. This is a one-paragraph fix.

2. **`_get_cli_org_id` permission gate, for endpoints reachable outside the engine.** The surviving CLI endpoints fall into two categories: ones that genuinely should be engine-only (configs, integrations management, knowledge mutation, AI completion) and the table-document handlers we're consolidating away. The first category is fine as-is for now — they're behind regular bearer auth, and the practical exposure is limited. The CLI table-document handlers go away as part of consolidation. **No new gate is added in this PR.** (We deliberately don't change `_get_cli_org_id`'s no-permission-check behavior on the surviving endpoints because doing so requires knowing what they should enforce, which is a separate audit.)

3. **Dual scope-resolution in workflow dispatch.** `workflows.py:807-832` and `workflow_execution.py:540-549` both implement the "workflow's org if set, else caller's org" rule. This is real drift waiting to happen. Out of scope for this PR (the rule is consistent today, the duplication is a refactor opportunity, not a bug). Note it for a follow-up cleanup.

4. **`is_provider` not populated in the API handler's `Organization`.** `workflows.py:867` constructs `Organization(id=..., name="", is_active=True)` without `is_provider`. Currently throwaway because the worker re-fetches (`workflow_execution.py:643-647`), but a footgun. Out of scope; cleanup ticket.

## Out of scope, captured for later

- **`is_superuser` → `is_provider` migration in `resolve_target_org` and `resolve_org_filter`.** Real change in who-can-do-what (a non-superuser provider-org member would gain cross-org access; a hypothetical superuser outside the provider org would lose it). Today's rule (`is_superuser` as the gate) continues unchanged.

- **`DeveloperContext` rationalization.** Currently spread across `_get_cli_org_id` (cli.py:384), `workflows.py:826-832`, `cli.py:606+` (the `bifrost run` direct path), and the entire `bifrost run --interactive` session machinery (`cli.py:846+`, `client/src/pages/CLI.tsx`, the `/api/cli/sessions/*` endpoints, the `cli-sessions:{user.id}` WebSocket channel). The interactive path is alive and used. Removing `DeveloperContext` is a non-trivial refactor — defer.

- **The other `/api/cli/*` endpoints** — configs, integrations management, knowledge mutation, AI. Engine-only by design; not consolidated.

- **Embed token org scoping.** `auth.py:201-211` exempts embed tokens from the "non-superuser must have org" rule. Works today; no failing tests; pinning down with explicit tests is its own pass.

- **Raw `WHERE organization_id = ...` patterns** scattered through routers (workflows.py, knowledge_sources.py, roi_reports.py, executions.py, users.py, export_import.py — see prior session's audit). Most are correct given correct upstream resolvers; full audit is a separate sweep.

## Decisions required before implementation

These are the only items where I want input before any code change:

1. **`created_by` / `updated_by` body override on the consolidated REST endpoints.** Keep current CLI behavior (workflows can attribute writes to specific users) by adding to `DocumentCreate` / `DocumentUpdate`, or accept that consolidated workflow writes are attributed to the engine? Default if undecided: **add the override**, gated to engine-attested callers only.

2. **`?app=<uuid>` on REST table lookup.** Required to preserve the same-name-different-app SDK behavior. Add it to `get_table_or_404` and the relevant REST endpoints? Default if undecided: **yes** — small change, preserves existing SDK semantics.

3. **Atomic `POST /api/tables/{id}/documents/upsert` as an explicit verb on REST**, or have the SDK use `batch` with one doc? Default if undecided: **explicit verb** — one round trip, cleaner SDK code, the same SQL pattern (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`).

## Plan stack

If decisions above land defaults:

1. Add `?app=<uuid>` query param to REST `get_table_or_404`. Wire through to the relevant document endpoints.
2. Add `created_by` / `updated_by` to `DocumentCreate` / `DocumentUpdate`, accept only when caller is engine-attested.
3. Add `POST /api/tables/{id}/documents/upsert` to REST.
4. Move auto-create-on-insert into the Python SDK (`tables.insert` and `tables.insert_batch`): catch 404, post `/api/tables`, retry.
5. Repoint Python SDK's `tables.documents.*` methods at the REST URLs.
6. Delete CLI table-document handlers (cli.py:2818-3370) and the helpers `_find_or_create_table_for_sdk`, `_find_table_for_sdk` if no surviving callers.
7. Validate `scope` as UUID/`"global"`/null in `_get_cli_org_id`. (Independent small fix.)

Each step is independently reviewable. After step 6 lands, web UI and SDK share one table-document path; policy/WS/audit happen uniformly. Step 7 closes a small validation gap on the CLI endpoints that remain.
