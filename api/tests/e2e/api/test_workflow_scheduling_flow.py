"""E2E: end-to-end flow of schedule → promote → run; cancel-after-promote.

Covers the gaps left by Task 5/6 tests:

- Promote happy path: schedule with ``delay_seconds``, wait for maturity,
  trigger the promoter directly (for test speed), then verify the worker
  runs the promoted row to ``Success``. The worker's ``create_execution``
  upserts in place when a pre-existing scheduled row is found, so the
  promoted row's PK is reused rather than colliding.
- Cancel-after-promote returns 409: once the row has been flipped past
  ``SCHEDULED`` (simulated by a direct DB UPDATE so the test does not
  depend on worker wiring), the cancel endpoint must refuse with 409.
- Validation sanity: past ``scheduled_at`` and ``sync=True + delay_seconds``
  both return 422 (redundant with contract unit tests, but one e2e pass
  per plan).

Auth cases (non-admin cross-user cancel → 403) are deferred; they need a
second authenticated user that the current fixtures don't provide cheaply.
