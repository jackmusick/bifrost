"""End-to-end (live): a Solution whose shared deps have been VENDORED into its
bundle installs self-contained and its ``shared.*`` import resolves WITHOUT
global-repo-access (criterion 5).

This is the falsifiable proof of vendoring: vendor_shared_deps pulls a
``shared.*`` module into the bundle as ``shared/<x>.py``; deploy installs it
under ``_solutions/{id}/shared/<x>.py``; the workflow's ``from shared.x import``
then resolves to the vendored copy via the per-execution solution import root —
even though global_repo_access is OFF (so a non-vendored _repo/ import would
fail, as proven in test_solution_deploy_execution.py).
