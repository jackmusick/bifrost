"""Deploy must not mutate S3 until the DB transaction is durable (Codex P1-c).

The deployer writes Python source to ``_solutions/{id}/`` and builds app
``dist/``. If those S3 writes happen *before* the router commits and the commit
then fails, running solution code is changed while the DB metadata rolls back.

Guarantee under test: ``deploy()`` performs ONLY DB work and returns a
``DeployResult`` carrying a deferred ``finalize_s3`` coroutine factory. No S3
write (no Python source, no app build) happens until the caller — after a
successful ``commit()`` — awaits ``finalize_s3()``.
