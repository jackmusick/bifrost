"""SolutionAppBuilder — server-side vite build → _apps/{app_id}/dist/ (criterion 12).

The builder turns a v2 app's transient src/ into a built dist/ and uploads it to
_apps/{app_id}/dist/. A bundle may instead ship a prebuilt dist/ (disconnected
fast-path), in which case the vite build is skipped entirely. src/ is NEVER
written under _solutions/.
