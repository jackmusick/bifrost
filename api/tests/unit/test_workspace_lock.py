"""Unit tests for the per-workspace exclusion lock.

The lock guards `bifrost watch` / `bifrost sync` / `bifrost push` /
`bifrost pull` against the multi-session_id ping-pong: two sessions in one
workspace publish events with distinct session_ids that the server can't
dedupe, so they bounce each other's writes back as "incoming."

Properties under test:

- A second acquire on the same workspace fails with `WorkspaceLockError`.
- The error message exposes the holder's PID + command + start time so
  the user can find and stop them.
- Releasing (or letting the FD go out of scope) lets a fresh acquire
  succeed.
- The lock file lives under `.bifrost/.session.lock`. We do not test
  `flock` semantics on NFS / Windows here — the wrappers in
  `_workspace_lock.py` rely on platform-native primitives that the
  kernel manages.
- After a process holding the lock dies (subprocess that opens the lock
  and is then SIGKILLed), the next acquire from this process succeeds —
  i.e. no manual cleanup is needed.
