"""
Effective-scope resolution for Bifrost.

ONE function. ONE rule table. Used by every entry point that needs to decide
"what org_id should we operate against, given who is calling and what they
asked for?"

See `api/src/repositories/README.md` for the full pattern, including how this
function interacts with `OrgScopedRepository` and the cascade primitive.

The trust model:
    - The engine sentinel authenticates to the API as a single fixed superuser
      identity and resolves scope SDK-side using this function.
    - Direct user-facing endpoints (REST hit by the UI) apply this function
      against the authenticated user; principal IS caller.
    - MCP authenticates as the user directly and does not go through this
      pattern.

If the engine sentinel credential leaks, this entire isolation model
collapses. That is a known and accepted cost of the architecture.
