"""Per-message visibility decision for table subscriptions.

The websocket layer receives `document_change` events with both the pre-mutation
row (`old_row`) and the post-mutation row (`new_row`). For each subscriber, the
visibility of these two rows under the table's policies (and any user-supplied
filter) determines which event — if any — to deliver:

    old_visible | new_visible | emitted action
    ----------- | ----------- | --------------
    False       | False       | (nothing — row stays out of view)
    False       | True        | "insert" (row becomes visible)
    True        | False       | "delete" (row leaves visibility)
    True        | True        | "update" (row stays in view, content changed)

This module centralizes that logic so it can be unit-tested without standing
up a websocket connection. The websocket router calls `decide_visibility_change`
once per message per subscriber.
