"""Server-side source of truth for the CLI contract version.

This integer is returned to the CLI at ``GET /api/version`` as
``contract_version`` and compared against the CLI's baked-in value to decide
whether a CLI is contract-compatible with this server.

**Bump this (and the CLI mirror in ``api/bifrost/contract_version.py``) only on
a BREAKING change to the contract surface the CLI consumes** — a request/response
DTO field removed/renamed/retyped, or a route the CLI calls renamed. Additive
or cosmetic changes do NOT bump it. The tripwire in
``tests/unit/test_contract_version.py`` forces this decision at PR time.
