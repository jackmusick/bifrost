"""
External-user claim resolution (EXT-1).

``User.is_external`` marks portal/guest users. The flag is enforced at the
access-level gate only: externals are excluded from
``access_level="authenticated"`` entities, admitted by ``"everyone"`` and by
explicit role grants; org→global cascade is unchanged (see
``api/src/repositories/README.md``, "External users live at gate 3 only").
The restriction applies only to EXTERNAL, NON-BYPASS principals, where bypass
is the canonical scope-bypass rule from the same README:

    bypass = is_platform_admin OR is_provider_org

This helper computes the ``is_external`` JWT claim at token mint, neutralizing
the raw DB flag for bypass callers, so every downstream consumer
(``UserPrincipal.is_external`` → repositories, routers, MCP) can treat the
claim as "externally restricted principal" without re-deriving provider-org
membership per request.
