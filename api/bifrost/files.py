"""
File management SDK for Bifrost.

Provides async Python API for file operations with two storage modes:
- local: Local filesystem (CWD, /tmp/bifrost/temp, /tmp/bifrost/uploads)
- cloud: S3 storage (default)

Location Options:
- "workspace": Persistent workspace files (CWD in local mode, S3 bucket root in cloud mode)
- "temp": Temporary files (_tmp/ prefix in cloud, /tmp/bifrost/temp in local)
- "uploads": Files uploaded via form file fields (uploads/ prefix in cloud, /tmp/bifrost/uploads in local)

Usage:
    from bifrost import files

    # Write to workspace (cloud mode by default)
    await files.write("exports/report.csv", data)

    # Write to workspace (local mode)
    await files.write("exports/report.csv", data, mode="local")

    # Read from temp location
    content = await files.read("temp-data.txt", location="temp")

    # Read uploaded file
    content = await files.read("form_id/uuid/filename.txt", location="uploads")
"""

# `location` is a free string. Reserved names: "workspace", "temp", "uploads".
# Anything else is a freeform user-defined location (e.g. "reports", "exports").
