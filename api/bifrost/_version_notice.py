"""Dedupe helper for the soft 'update available' notice (Gate 2).

When the CLI is contract-compatible but on a different build version than the
server, we show a one-line nudge — but only once per (API URL, server version),
so it doesn't fire on every command.

The marker lives in the OS temp dir (``tempfile.gettempdir()`` — resolves on
Linux ``/tmp``, macOS ``/var/folders/...``, Windows ``%TEMP%`` with one code
path) keyed by a STABLE digest of the URL. We deliberately avoid Python's
built-in ``hash()`` here: it is per-process randomized (``PYTHONHASHSEED``), so
two CLI invocations would key to different files and dedupe would never work.

All I/O is best-effort: a permission/collision/stale-marker problem can only
cause a missed-or-extra notice, never a wrong block — callers must keep this
isolated from the hard-gate decision.
