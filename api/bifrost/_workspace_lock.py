"""Per-workspace exclusion lock for `bifrost watch` / `bifrost sync`.

Two `bifrost watch` instances pointed at the same workspace, or a `bifrost
sync` running concurrently with a `bifrost watch`, both produce broken
behavior — distinct session_ids that the server can't dedupe, so they ping-
pong each other's writes back as "incoming" events. This module enforces
single-session-per-workspace using an OS-level file lock.

Why an OS lock and not a PID file:

A PID file requires us to detect stale entries (process died without
cleaning up) by checking whether the PID is still alive — racy and gets
fooled by PID reuse. `fcntl.flock` (POSIX) and `msvcrt.locking` (Windows)
are kernel-tracked: when the file descriptor is released — *whatever* the
reason: clean exit, Ctrl-C, SIGKILL, OOM, panic, reboot — the kernel
releases the lock automatically. There is no reaper, no TTL, no stale
state to clean up.

The lock file *also* records PID + command + start time, but as
informational metadata only — the lock itself is the FD, not the file.
