"""Consolidated agent tuning session contracts.

A *consolidated tuning session* takes all currently-flagged runs for an
agent (verdict='down'), feeds them and their per-flag tuning conversations
to the tuning model in a single shot, and proposes one consolidated prompt
change. The user can dry-run the proposal across the same set of flagged
runs and apply it; applying records an :class:`AgentPromptHistory` row,
updates :class:`Agent.system_prompt`, and clears the verdict on the
affected runs so they re-enter the review queue under the new prompt.
