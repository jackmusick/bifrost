"""
Solution ORM model.

A Solution is an *installable surface* — the deployable unit installed onto a
Bifrost instance (success-criteria doc §3.1). Each row here is one **install**,
identified by ``id`` (the ``solution_id`` stamped on managed entities). One
Solution *definition* (same ``slug``) can be installed multiple times — once per
scope — producing multiple rows with the same slug and distinct ids/scopes
(§3.4).

Scope (§3.3) is expressed with the platform's existing scoping system via
``organization_id``: a UUID = org scope (visible to that one org), ``NULL`` =
global scope (visible across the tenant). There is no per-entity scope binding —
the install's scope is inherited by everything it deploys.

Source mode (§3.9) keeps the one-writer invariant: a *disconnected* install is
written only by ``bifrost deploy``; a *git-connected* install
(``git_connected=True``) is written only by auto-pull from its repo, and deploy
is refused.
