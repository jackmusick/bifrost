Organization Filter Helper

Provides consistent organization filtering logic across endpoints.
Replaces the deprecated X-Organization-Id header approach with query parameters.

Scope Parameter Values:
- Not sent / omitted → show all (no filter) - superusers only
- "global" → filter to organization_id IS NULL only
- "{uuid}" → filter to specific org + global records
