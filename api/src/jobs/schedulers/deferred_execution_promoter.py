"""Deferred execution promoter.

Every 60 seconds, moves SCHEDULED executions whose ``scheduled_at`` has
matured onto the RabbitMQ workflow-executions queue by flipping them to
PENDING and calling the shared ``_publish_pending`` helper.

Design notes:

- The promotion UPDATE is committed BEFORE the per-row publish loop, so
  PENDING is the authoritative record that "this run belongs to RabbitMQ
  now". If the broker publish fails we best-effort revert the row back to
  SCHEDULED so the next tick retries.
- ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` keeps the job safe to run in
  parallel (multiple scheduler pods / APScheduler threads): each batch
  picks a disjoint set of rows.
- ``LIMIT 500`` bounds recovery bursts after an outage — if 10k rows
  matured while the promoter was down, they drain in controlled batches.
- ``user_email`` is intentionally an empty string: the Execution row does
  not persist the triggering user's email. The worker hydrates it from
  the User record keyed by ``executed_by``. ``startup=None`` for the same
  reason — startup results are per-session context and would be stale by
  the time a scheduled row matures.
