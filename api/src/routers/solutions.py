"""REST endpoints for Solutions — installable surfaces (success-criteria §3).

An install is created here, then deployed via ``POST /{id}/deploy`` (the single
writer for a disconnected install). Deploy is a full replace by contract and is
non-interactive — it always applies the whole bundle.

Solution-management itself is an admin operation; the deployed *entities* are
what end users see (the Solution is invisible to them — criterion 16).
