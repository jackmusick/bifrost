"""Tool invocation entry point — called by agent executors in Phase 3.

This is the single dispatch path for an agent calling an external MCP
tool. The chat executor and the autonomous executor both route through
``invoke``. ``caller_user_id`` is threaded all the way down so the
``auth_resolution`` layer makes the user-vs-service decision exactly
once per call.

Result envelope: the MCP SDK returns ``CallToolResult`` (a Pydantic model
with ``content``, ``structuredContent``, and ``isError``). We normalize
this to a plain ``dict`` matching the shape Bifrost workflow tools
return — the executor wraps this dict in a ``ToolResult`` envelope. We
keep the structured content first-class because LLMs prefer JSON output
over text when both are available, and we keep the text content as a
fallback for tools that haven't migrated to structured output.

401/403 retry: if the vendor returns an auth error AFTER token resolution
(meaning the token was fresh-by-our-clock but the vendor disagrees), we
attempt a single forced refresh and retry. If still 401/403, we raise
``NeedsReauthError`` for the chat case and ``ToolDispatchError`` for the
autonomous case (an autonomous run can't prompt a user to reconnect).
