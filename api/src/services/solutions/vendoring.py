"""Back-compat re-export of the shared-dependency vendoring helpers.

The canonical implementation lives in ``bifrost.solution_vendoring`` because it
runs **client-side** during ``bifrost deploy`` (the installed CLI has no ``src``
package on its path). Server-side code and tests may keep importing it from
here. See ``bifrost/solution_vendoring.py`` for the implementation.
