"""
Git-connected Solution auto-pull (success-criteria §3.9, criterion 13).

A git-connected install has exactly one writer: auto-pull from its repo. The
platform clones/pulls the connected repo's ``main`` and deploys the workspace
found there via :class:`SolutionDeployer`. ``bifrost deploy`` and the REST deploy
endpoint are refused for a connected install (enforced in the deploy router), so
the one-writer invariant holds.

This module deliberately does NOT touch ``_repo/``: a connected Solution is its
own world, cloned to a throwaway checkout and deployed straight to
``_solutions/{id}/``. It reuses the CLI's own collectors (layout-agnostic Python
source from any folder, ``.bifrost/*.yaml`` manifest) so a git-connected deploy
bundles exactly what ``bifrost deploy`` would.
