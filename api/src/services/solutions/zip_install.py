"""Drag-and-drop ZIP install for Solutions (success-criteria §3, Tasks 11+12).

A "zip" is a compressed Solution *workspace* — the same shape ``bifrost export``
produces: a ``bifrost.solution.yaml`` descriptor + ``.bifrost/*.yaml`` manifests
+ ``apps/`` and ``workflows/`` source. The server unzips it and runs the EXISTING
deploy pipeline (:class:`SolutionDeployer`) — it does NOT reinvent deploy.

Two phases:

* :func:`preview_zip` — unzip to a temp dir, PARSE manifests only (no build, no
  DB write, no S3). Returns what the install would create + its declared configs.
* :func:`install_zip` — unzip, resolve-or-create the install at the chosen scope,
  run the proven lock → deploy → commit → finalize_s3 section, and IN THE SAME
  LOCKED SECTION after finalize, apply any provided config VALUES. Atomic: the
  install never exists without its just-entered secrets.

The workspace parsers are the CLI collectors in ``bifrost.commands.solution`` —
imported and reused server-side (the ``bifrost`` package is on the api path; the
git-sync module already imports these collectors). Reuse, not replication.
