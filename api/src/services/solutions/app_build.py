"""
SolutionAppBuilder — server-side Vite build for v2 standalone apps (criterion 12).

A v2 app's transient ``src/`` is built into a ``dist/`` and uploaded to
``_apps/{app_id}/dist/``, from which the platform serves the standalone app. A
deploy bundle may instead ship a prebuilt ``dist/`` (the disconnected fast-path),
in which case the Vite build is skipped. App ``src/`` is NEVER persisted under
``_solutions/`` — it is transient build input only (success-criteria §3.6).

This is the ONE canonical build path: git-connected installs always build here
(from the clone); disconnected installs build here too unless they pre-ship
``dist/``.
