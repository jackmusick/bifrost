"""Helpers for tracking progress of summary backfill jobs.

When an admin triggers a backfill via ``POST /api/agent-runs/backfill-summaries``,
we enqueue one ``agent-summarization`` message per run with a ``backfill_job_id``
tag. The summarize worker calls :func:`record_backfill_outcome` after each
run's summarizer finishes so we can update the orchestration row, emit a
progress broadcast, and flip the job to ``complete`` on the last one.
