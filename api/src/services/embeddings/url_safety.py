"""
SSRF mitigation for admin-configured embedding endpoints.

The whole `/api/admin/llm/*` surface is gated by `RequirePlatformAdmin`, but
admin-supplied URLs still flow into outbound HTTP requests — partial SSRF.
This module validates a URL is safe to fetch:

- Scheme must be `http` or `https` (`http` is allowed because Ollama and
  some local-LLM setups don't terminate TLS).
- Hostname must resolve to a public address (rejects private RFC1918,
  loopback, link-local, reserved, multicast, unspecified).

To support Ollama / local LLMs that legitimately bind to private addresses,
operators can opt-in trusted hostnames via the `EMBEDDING_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
env var (comma-separated, case-insensitive, exact match). Hosts in that list
skip the address-class check entirely.

The "right" trust boundary is admin auth, but defense-in-depth here is cheap
and matches the existing `_validate_spec_url` helper in services/sdk_generator.py.
