# Org Scoping in Bifrost

This is the single source of truth for how organization scoping works.

If you are touching code that reads or writes anything with an
`organization_id` column, **read this file before you write code.** The
pattern is mandatory by default; exemptions are explicit.

The companion implementation is `api/src/repositories/org_scoped.py`. The
companion resolver is `api/shared/scope_resolver.py`. The companion lint
tests live under `api/tests/unit/` and fail CI when this pattern is
bypassed.

---

## The pattern in one paragraph

Every execution-resolution entity (Config, Table, OAuth, etc.) goes through
`OrgScopedRepository`. There is exactly one cascade primitive (org-specific
OR global), exactly one scope resolver function, exactly two repository
methods (`get` for single-entity resolution, `list` for enumeration).
User-ness is encoded in the repository instance, not the method names.
Identity entities (Organization, User, UserRole, OAuthAccount, AuditLog)
are not org-resolved and bypass this pattern.

---

## Trust model

There are two entry paths into the API:

1. **Engine sentinel → API.** The engine authenticates as a single fixed
   superuser identity (`SYSTEM_USER_ID`). The SDK running inside the
   workflow process reads `context.caller` and resolves scope locally via
   `resolve_effective_scope` before making the API call. The API receives
   the resolved scope and trusts it because the principal is the sentinel.
   **The sentinel credential is the security boundary; if it leaks, this
   isolation model collapses.** That is a known and accepted cost.

2. **User → API directly.** REST endpoints hit by the UI authenticate the
   user. The API applies the same resolver against the authenticated user
   (principal IS caller, no indirection).

MCP does NOT follow this pattern. MCP authenticates as the user directly
and is out of scope for the engine-sentinel model.

---

## The four scope-resolution rules

Implemented in `api/shared/scope_resolver.py::resolve_effective_scope`.

| `requested_scope`         | Allowed if...       | Result          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| UNSET (unspecified)       | always              | `caller_org_id` |
| explicit `None` (global)  | `is_platform_admin` | `None`          |
| `caller_org_id`           | always              | `caller_org_id` |
| any other UUID            | `is_platform_admin` | that UUID       |

**UNSET and explicit `None` are NOT the same.** UNSET means "the caller
didn't specify a scope; use their default." Explicit `None` means "the
caller is asking for global." Collapsing these is a bug class — only
platform admins can request global, but everyone can omit the field.

The resolver raises `ScopeNotAllowed` for any unauthorized request. It
NEVER silently coerces an unauthorized scope into something benign.
"Just return caller_org_id as a safe default" would hide cross-tenant
breaches.

---

## The two repository methods

`OrgScopedRepository` exposes exactly two methods. User-ness lives on the
repository instance (`user_id`, `is_superuser`); the methods themselves
have no user-aware variants.

### `repo.get(name=...)` or `repo.get(id=...)`

Resolve one entity. SDK execution path.

- **Name/key lookup**: cascade with override semantic. Try org-specific
  first; fall back to global. Returns at most one row. If an org-specific
  entry exists with the same name as a global one, the org entry wins.
- **ID lookup**: globally unique, no cascade. Returns the entity directly.
  Access checks still apply (superusers bypass; regular users must be in
  scope and pass role check).

### `repo.list()`

Enumerate everything visible. UI execution path.

- Cascade union: returns both org-specific and global entries. Name
  collisions are NOT resolved — both rows are returned. UI shows them
  side-by-side.
- Role filter applies automatically when the repository was constructed
  with a regular user (`user_id` set, `is_superuser=False`). Skipped for
  superusers.

### How the user-ness is encoded

```python
# Direct user endpoint (REST hit by the UI)
repo = TableRepository(
    db,
    org_id=user.org_id,
    user_id=user.id,
    is_superuser=user.is_superuser,
)

# SDK execution endpoint (engine has already resolved scope)
repo = TableRepository(
    db,
    org_id=resolved_scope,
    is_superuser=True,  # the engine sentinel is trusted
)
```

Same `list()` call, different behavior, baked into the instance.

---

## Cascade is centralized; caching is per-repository

Cascade is the cross-cutting concern: every execution-resolution entity
needs org-then-global. It lives in `OrgScopedRepository` as one primitive
used by both `get` and `list`. **No subclass reimplements cascade. No
router writes inline cascade queries.**

Caching is a per-entity concern (only Config caches today; maybe Knowledge
later; most entities don't). When an entity needs caching, it's a thin
transparent layer **inside that repository** wrapping the standard
methods. The cache layer calls the cascade primitive on miss; it does
NOT reimplement cascade. Cache invalidation hooks live on the repository,
not in `core/cache/invalidation.py`.

---

## Entity classification

Twenty-four ORM models carry `organization_id`. The classification is
encoded in the codebase (one-line comment above each model class) and
verified by a mechanical test
(`test_org_scoped_models_have_repository`). Adding a new org-scoped
model without classifying it fails CI.

### Execution-resolution (15) — accessed via `OrgScopedRepository`

| Entity              | Role Table         | Direct User Access | Notes                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |

### Identity (9) — NOT org-resolved, NOT subject to cascade

| Entity                 | Why exempt                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution              | Execution telemetry; not resolved by name with cascade                      |
| ExecutionMetricsDaily  | Aggregated execution telemetry                                              |
| WorkflowROIDaily       | Aggregated ROI telemetry                                                    |
| KnowledgeStorageDaily  | Aggregated storage telemetry                                                |
| User                   | Identity record; looked up by ID for auth/audit, not by name with cascade   |
| AIUsage                | AI cost/usage telemetry                                                     |
| KnowledgeNamespaceRole | RBAC junction; consumed by KnowledgeRepository, not resolved as an entity   |
| Event                  | Event record post-receipt (telemetry)                                       |
| AuditLog               | Write-only from execution path; no cascade lookup ever                      |

Three additional entities are identity but do NOT carry an
`organization_id` column themselves: `Organization` (it IS the org),
`UserRole` (junction to users), `OAuthAccount` (joins to users via
SSO flows). They are included here for completeness but are not part
of the `organization_id`-bearing count.

---

## `access_level` semantics

For entities that have it:

- `'authenticated'` — Any user who can cascade to this scope can access.
- `'role_based'` — User must have a matching role in the entity's role
  table.
- `'private'` — Owner only (checks `owner_user_id`).
- Entities without role tables don't have `access_level`.

---

## Creating a repository

For an entity with RBAC:

```python
from src.repositories import OrgScopedRepository
from src.models.orm import MyEntity, MyEntityRole

class MyEntityRepository(OrgScopedRepository[MyEntity]):
    model = MyEntity
    role_table = MyEntityRole
    role_entity_id_column = "entity_id"
```

For an entity without RBAC:

```python
class MyEntityRepository(OrgScopedRepository[MyEntity]):
    model = MyEntity
    # No role_table — cascade only
```

That's it. The base class provides `get` and `list`. The cascade primitive
is already correct. Do not override these methods unless you're adding
caching, and even then call into the base via `super()` rather than
reimplementing.

---

## Usage examples

### Direct user access (REST endpoint hit by the UI)

```python
@router.get("/{slug}")
async def get_application(slug: str, ctx: Context, user: CurrentUser):
    repo = ApplicationRepository(
        ctx.db,
        org_id=ctx.org_id,
        user_id=ctx.user.user_id,
        is_superuser=ctx.user.is_superuser,
    )
    return await repo.can_access(slug=slug)
```

### Workflow execution authorization (use workflow's org, not caller's)

```python
workflow_repo = WorkflowRepository(
    session=db,
    org_id=workflow.organization_id,
    user_id=ctx.user.user_id,
    is_superuser=ctx.user.is_superuser,
)
await workflow_repo.can_access(id=workflow_id)
```

### SDK data access (engine has already resolved scope)

```python
# Engine sentinel is trusted; pass the resolved scope through.
repo = TableRepository(
    session=db,
    org_id=execution_org_id,
    is_superuser=True,
)
table = await repo.get(name=table_name)
```

---

## When NOT to use this pattern

Some endpoints don't touch execution-resolution entities and are exempt.
The exemption is explicit (allow-list entry in
`test_sdk_endpoints_use_resolver`) with a one-line justification per
endpoint. Categories:

- **Auth and session.** Login, token refresh, whoami, dev context.
  The caller's identity is the input; no org parameter.
- **Health, version, capabilities.** Pings, OpenAPI spec, CLI download.
- **Cross-org platform admin operations.** Listing all orgs, creating an
  org, user provisioning. These intentionally span orgs and have their
  own platform-admin guard at the endpoint level.
- **Execution-scoped telemetry.** Fetching logs/results for a specific
  `execution_id`. The execution itself carries its scope; the endpoint
  needs `is_caller_allowed_to_see_this_execution`, not scope cascade.

If you're adding a new endpoint and it fits one of these categories,
document why in the endpoint's docstring AND add the allow-list entry.
If it doesn't fit, use the pattern.

---

## Common mistakes

- **Inline cascade queries in router files.** `WHERE organization_id ==
  org_id OR organization_id IS NULL` written by hand in a handler. Use
  the repository. The lint test catches this on PR.
- **Trusting `requested_scope` directly.** Passing whatever the request
  body contained as `org_id` to the repository without going through
  `resolve_effective_scope`. This was the `_get_cli_org_id` bug class.
- **Using `BaseRepository` for org-scoped entities.** Always use
  `OrgScopedRepository`. The lint test catches missing repositories on
  models with `organization_id`.
- **Collapsing UNSET and explicit `None`.** They have different security
  semantics. Only platform admins can request global; everyone can omit
  the scope field.
- **Using `ctx.org_id` for workflow execution authorization.** Use the
  workflow's `organization_id`, not the caller's. The workflow's scope
  is the relevant authority during execution.
- **Forgetting cascade affects superusers too.** For name lookups,
  cascade determines which entity is returned, even for superusers.
  A superuser asking for "users" in org A gets org A's `users` table,
  not the global one.
- **Reimplementing cascade in a subclass.** The base class is the only
  place the cascade primitive (`or_(org_id == X, org_id.is_(None))`)
  appears. If you find yourself writing it again, stop.
- **Adding cache invalidation logic to `core/cache/invalidation.py` for a
  specific entity.** Cache invalidation hooks live on the repository
  that owns the cache.

---

## Mechanical enforcement

Three tests ensure this pattern doesn't drift again:

1. `test_no_inline_org_scoping_in_routers` — AST-walks
   `api/src/routers/` and fails if any file contains a raw
   `organization_id ==` comparison or `organization_id.is_(None)`
   outside whitelisted lines.
2. `test_org_scoped_models_have_repository` — for every ORM model with
   an `organization_id` column, asserts there is a corresponding
   `OrgScopedRepository` subclass or the model is on the explicit
   identity-entity allow-list.
3. `test_sdk_endpoints_use_resolver` — for every endpoint that declares
   a `scope` parameter, asserts the handler calls
   `resolve_effective_scope`. Allow-list with per-entry justification
   for exempt endpoints.

Allow-list entries require a one-line comment. Adding one is visible
in code review.

## Historical context

Services that have been absorbed into this pattern:

- `api/src/services/authorization.py` — `AuthorizationService`
- `api/src/services/execution_auth.py` — `ExecutionAuthService`

The goal of the 2026-05 consolidation was to make org scoping in Bifrost
stop drifting. See `docs/plans/2026-05-26-org-scoping-consolidation.md`
and the companion audits under `docs/audits/`.
