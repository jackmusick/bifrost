const BOOTSTRAP = `
YOU PROVISION YOUR OWN STACK. Do this before any testing, and tear it down at the end.

1. Create an isolated worktree off the branch under test:
   AXIS=<your-axis-key>
   WT=/tmp/qa-$AXIS
   git -C ${BASE_WORKTREE} worktree add "$WT" HEAD
   cd "$WT"

2. Boot a PORT-MODE stack (MANDATORY — netbird stacks can't be driven by a browser):
   env -u NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY ./debug.sh up
   ./debug.sh status        # capture the http://localhost:<port> URL — call it $URL
   If the api container is not healthy within ~90s, retry \`env -u NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY ./debug.sh down && env -u NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY ./debug.sh up\` ONCE. If still unhealthy, set blocked=true in your output and STOP (do not invent findings).

3. Install the API-matched CLI in a scratch dir OUTSIDE the repo:
   mkdir -p /tmp/qa-cli-$AXIS && cd /tmp/qa-cli-$AXIS
   python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install --quiet --upgrade pip
   .venv/bin/pip install --quiet "$URL/api/cli/download"
   .venv/bin/bifrost login --url "$URL" --email dev@gobifrost.com --password password
   Run the CLI FROM /tmp/qa-cli-$AXIS (its .env carries the tokens). Default creds: dev@gobifrost.com / password (superuser, MFA off).

4. Drive the UI with Playwright against $URL (headless is fine). Capture screenshots
   to /tmp/qa-$AXIS/shots/ for any UI finding and put the path in observed.

5. TEARDOWN (always, even on failure): cd "$WT" && env -u NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY ./debug.sh down ; git -C ${BASE_WORKTREE} worktree remove --force "$WT"

RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:
- VERIFY EMPIRICALLY. Reading code forms hypotheses; driving the running stack concludes. A finding is REAL only if you reproduced it on your stack — include exact commands/URLs/clicks and observed-vs-expected.
- You MAY create solutions/workflows/tables/configs/forms/apps and install them to orgs to set up tests. Correctness findings matter more than tidiness.
- Do NOT modify product source. This is a drive/audit pass. Throwaway fixtures via CLI/API/UI are fine.
- If you could not boot a healthy stack, return blocked=true with an empty findings array — never fabricate.

const AXES = [
  {
    key: 'scope-isolation',
    prompt: `${BOOTSTRAP}

YOUR AXIS: SCOPE / CROSS-ORG ISOLATION (the #1 fear). Set AXIS=scope-isolation in the bootstrap.
Drive empirically on your own stack:
1. Create two orgs (CLI: \`bifrost orgs create\`). Install a solution (workflow + table + config) to OrgA only.
2. As a principal in OrgB (use --org on execute, or impersonate as superuser), confirm OrgB CANNOT resolve/execute OrgA's install's workflow by path, CANNOT read its table, CANNOT see its config value.
3. Forge an X-Bifrost-App header naming OrgA's app while authenticated as an OrgB user; confirm it does NOT reach OrgA's table (curl the API with the OrgB bearer token from your scratch .env).
4. Superuser scope-override: confirm pinning scope to OrgA returns OrgA's entities and to OrgB returns OrgB's — never bleeding.
5. S3 isolation: confirm OrgA's _solutions/{id}/ content is not readable as OrgB.
Return structured findings, axis="scope-isolation".`,
  },
  {
    key: 'lifecycle',
    prompt: `${BOOTSTRAP}

YOUR AXIS: INSTALL / UNINSTALL / REDEPLOY LIFECYCLE. Set AXIS=lifecycle in the bootstrap.
Drive empirically:
1. Full install round-trip (CLI \`bifrost solution install\` AND the Solutions UI page) — both must work.
2. Seed rows into an installed solution table, UNINSTALL, confirm the table+rows are ORPHANED not destroyed (orphaned_at set, solution_id NULL'd; visible via "Show orphaned" in UI). RE-INSTALL the same slug; confirm orphaned data REATTACHES (origin_solution_slug/id provenance) and row data survived.
3. Redeploy with a CHANGED table schema; rows must survive (deploy upserts the Table row, never deletes Documents).
4. Same-slug independence: two different installs of solutions sharing a workflow path each resolve their OWN workflow.
5. Install with config values (\`--set KEY=VALUE\` and via the UI install dialog); confirm values land on the install and are readable at runtime, instance-owned (not in the export bundle).
Return structured findings, axis="lifecycle".`,
  },
  {
    key: 'readonly-enforcement',
    prompt: `${BOOTSTRAP}

YOUR AXIS: READ-ONLY / MANAGED-ENTITY ENFORCEMENT. Set AXIS=readonly-enforcement in the bootstrap.
Deploy is the SOLE writer of solution-managed entities. Try to MUTATE managed forms/agents/tables/configs through EVERY surface and confirm each is refused (409 / skipped), not silently applied:
1. UI: open a solution-managed form/agent/app in the builder and try to edit/save.
2. CLI: \`bifrost forms update\` / \`agents update\` / \`tables update\` / \`configs set\` against a managed entity.
3. API: PATCH/PUT the managed entity directly with a superuser token.
4. \`/api/workflows/{id}/remap\` pointed at a managed form/agent's workflow binding.
5. MCP tools (if reachable) that mutate forms/agents/tables.
For each: is it blocked with a clear error, or does it silently corrupt managed state? A silent mutation is a high/critical finding.
Return structured findings, axis="readonly-enforcement".`,
  },
  {
    key: 'global-repo-data-fallback',
    prompt: `${BOOTSTRAP}

YOUR AXIS: GLOBAL-REPO / DATA-FALLBACK. Set AXIS=global-repo-data-fallback in the bootstrap.
CODE fallback is gated by global_repo_access; DATA fallback (tables/configs/storage) is currently UNGATED by design — your job is to produce EVIDENCE on whether that asymmetry bites.
1. Install a solution with global_repo_access=FALSE that contains a workflow which \`from modules.x import y\` references a _repo/ module. Run it; confirm the _repo/ import does NOT resolve (sealed). Flip global_repo_access=TRUE, redeploy/re-run; confirm it now DOES resolve.
2. With a SEALED install (global_repo_access=FALSE): from its workflow, read a _repo/ TABLE by name and a _repo/ CONFIG by key that the install does NOT own. Document whether the sealed install can currently reach _repo/ DATA (expected: yes, ungated). Capture whether this serves surprising/wrong data (e.g. a _repo/ table shadowing an install-intended name).
3. Toggle global_repo_access OFF->ON and ON->OFF and re-run with a warm worker; confirm the per-execution import root reflects the current flag (no stale context bleed).
Return structured findings, axis="global-repo-data-fallback". In coverage_note, state plainly whether the ungated data fallback caused any real wrong-data outcome.`,
  },
  {
    key: 'ui-ux',
    prompt: `${BOOTSTRAP}

YOUR AXIS: UI/UX CORRECTNESS (drive the BROWSER with Playwright, screenshot everything). Set AXIS=ui-ux in the bootstrap.
1. Forms: render and SUBMIT a form (incl. a solution-managed form — confirm it runs the install's OWN workflow, not a _repo/ one). Watch for 404s/empty results.
2. Standalone v2 apps: open an installed solution's app; confirm it mounts and works.
3. BifrostHeader STANDALONE: a v2 app using the SDK BifrostHeader must render STYLED outside the platform theme (this was just fixed to use inline styles). Screenshot it; confirm it is NOT unstyled (has borders/spacing/colors, hover works).
4. Solutions install/manage page: install dialog, config-schema prompts (incl. secret-typed fields masked), "Show orphaned", uninstall confirm.
5. The Solutions page itself: list/preview/entity-summary chips render correctly.
Return structured findings, axis="ui-ux". Put screenshot paths in observed.`,
  },
  {
    key: 'cli-docs-literalism',
    prompt: `${BOOTSTRAP}

YOUR AXIS: CLI / DOCS-LITERALISM. Set AXIS=cli-docs-literalism in the bootstrap.
Be the user who copies the published docs VERBATIM and a user copying STALE patterns.
1. Follow CLAUDE.md's "Spinning up / connecting" and docs/llm.txt solution recipes exactly; note any step that doesn't work as written.
2. \`bifrost solution init\` -> \`scaffold-app\` -> \`deploy\` first-run path; confirm the scaffold's sample workflow actually deploys+runs (a prior bug dropped functions/).
3. \`bifrost watch\` INSIDE a solution workspace must REFUSE with the message pointing at \`bifrost solution start\` (just landed). Confirm. Then \`bifrost solution start\` local dev: app + local workflows behind one origin.
4. \`bifrost export --portable <dir>\` then \`bifrost import <dir> --org <uuid> --role-mode name\` into another org: clean round-trip? env-specific fields scrubbed? imported solution then INSTALLS and WORKS?
5. Try a stale pattern a user might copy from old docs (e.g. an old import flag, a removed subcommand) — does it fail with a helpful error or a confusing traceback?
Return structured findings, axis="cli-docs-literalism".`,

const CLEANUP_PROMPT = `
You are the PRE-FLIGHT CLEANUP for a QA fan-out. Do EXACTLY these, then report what you freed. Be careful and conservative — when unsure, KEEP.

1. KILL STRAY STACKS. List running bifrost stacks:
   docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep -E 'bifrost-(debug|test)' | sed -E 's/-(api|client|worker|scheduler|postgres|redis|rabbitmq|seaweedfs|pgbouncer|init)-[0-9]+$//' | sort -u
   For every project EXCEPT the one for ${BASE_WORKTREE} (its debug stack — KEEP it), tear it down with: \`docker compose -p <project> down\` (or stop its containers). Do NOT remove volumes you are unsure about; stopping is enough to free RAM.

2. PRUNE MERGED AGENT WORKTREES. For each branch matching 'worktree-agent-*' that is MERGED into main:
   git -C ${REPO} branch --merged main | grep -E 'worktree-agent-' | while read b; do
     wt=$(git -C ${REPO} worktree list | grep "\\[$b\\]" | awk '{print $1}')
     [ -n "$wt" ] && git -C ${REPO} worktree remove --force "$wt"
     git -C ${REPO} branch -d "$b"
   done
   NEVER touch named feature worktrees (entity-access, bridge-cse, pr-288-review, bifrost-plugin-testing, solutions-success-criteria, etc.). ONLY worktree-agent-* that are merged.

3. REPORT: RAM freed (free -m before/after), worktrees removed, branches deleted, what you KEPT and why. Return this as your text.
