# Bifrost Test Authoring Rules — Expanded

Companion to `SKILL.md`. Read when you need to know *how* to write a test, not *when*.

## Component tests (vitest + @testing-library/react)

**Location:** sibling of the component. `client/src/components/foo/Foo.tsx` → `client/src/components/foo/Foo.test.tsx`.

**What to cover:**
- Validation feedback (errors appear/disappear correctly in response to input)
- Conditional rendering (feature flags, loading/error/empty states)
- Event handlers (click → mutation called with right arguments)
- State transitions (dialog phases, toggle state)

**What to mock:**
- Hooks and external modules at module level with `vi.mock()`.
- Do not render the whole app. Don't pull `<Router>`, `<QueryClient>`, etc., unless the component explicitly requires them.
- Network calls are mocked via the hook wrappers, not MSW.

**Patterns:**
- Selectors: `userEvent.setup()` + `screen.getByRole()` / `getByLabel()` / `within()`. No `data-testid`.
- Helpers: define `makeThing()` and `renderFoo()` helpers at the top of the test file to reduce repetition.

**Reference implementations (copy these when starting a new test):**
- `client/src/components/applications/AppReplacePathDialog.test.tsx`
- `client/src/components/workflows/WorkflowSidebar.test.tsx`

**Exempt from requiring a sibling test:**
- Pure presentational wrappers: `<Card>`, `<PageHeader>`, static icon components.
- Re-exports.
- Trivial styled-div components with no branching behavior.

If in doubt whether a component is "trivial" — err on writing the test. If the component has a `useState`, a `useEffect`, or any conditional JSX, it has behavior worth asserting.

## Feature happy-path tests (Playwright)

**Location:** `client/e2e/<feature>.<audience>.spec.ts`, where audience is `admin`, `user`, or `unauth`.

**What to cover:**
- The primary user journey end-to-end: navigate, interact, verify the outcome appeared.
- Exactly one path per feature. Don't branch in a single spec.

**What NOT to cover here:**
- Validation error paths, permission-denied paths, "what if the form is empty" — those go in vitest.
- Every field permutation. Pick the representative happy path and stop.

**Selector conventions:**
- `page.getByRole()`, `page.getByLabel()`, `page.getByPlaceholder()`.
- No `data-testid`. (The existing suite does not use it; keep that consistent.)

**Wait strategy:**
- Condition-based: `waitForURL`, `getByRole(...).waitFor()`, `Promise.race([...])` when the outcome could be one of several states.
- **Never** `page.waitForTimeout()`. That's the signature of a flaky test-in-waiting.

## Backend unit tests

**Location:** `api/tests/unit/`.

**What to cover:** pure logic — anything that can run without a database, queue, or HTTP server.

**Patterns:** mock dependencies with `unittest.mock` or pytest fixtures. Don't use `./test.sh stack up` — unit tests run inside `test-runner` against an ephemeral config.

## Backend e2e tests

**Location:** `api/tests/e2e/`.

**What to cover:** anything that hits the real API, real DB, real queue, or real S3. Round-trip behavior.

**Isolation:** each test function gets a fresh DB (template clone) and an auto-clean S3 / redis module cache (see `api/tests/conftest.py` fixtures `isolate_s3` and `isolate_redis_module_cache`). Don't fight those — write tests that rely on them.

**Performance:** don't create hundreds of fixtures per test. Use the shared fixtures in `tests/e2e/fixtures/`.

## Running tests

All via `./test.sh`. Never `pytest` or `npx vitest` / `npx playwright` directly — the script manages the Dockerized test stack and state reset.

```bash
./test.sh                          # Backend unit tests (fast default)
./test.sh unit                     # Same
./test.sh e2e                      # Backend e2e tests
./test.sh all                      # Unit + e2e
./test.sh tests/unit/test_foo.py::test_bar -v   # Single test

./test.sh client unit              # Vitest on host
./test.sh client e2e               # Playwright in containers
./test.sh client e2e --screenshots # Capture screenshots for UX review
./test.sh client e2e e2e/auth.unauth.spec.ts    # Single spec
```

## Debugging failing tests

- Logs: `/tmp/bifrost-<project>/*.log` per service, per worktree.
- JUnit XML: `/tmp/bifrost/test-results.xml`.
- For flaky E2E: the answer is always state pollution from a prior test. Do not add retries. Run the failing test in isolation, then run it after a suspected neighbor, and find the dirty state the neighbor left behind.
