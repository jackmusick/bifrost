description: Boot an isolated, hot-reload Bifrost dev stack for the current worktree via ./debug.sh. Use when the user wants to click around the UI, view a feature in the browser, screenshot something, or otherwise needs the dev stack running. Per-worktree isolation lets multiple worktrees run dev stacks in parallel. Trigger phrases - "open the app", "let me click around", "spin up debug", "test in the browser", "show me the UI", "/bifrost-debug".

# Bifrost Debug

Bring up a per-worktree, hot-reload Bifrost dev stack via `./debug.sh`. Hand the user the URL. Don't restart containers for code changes (hot reload handles it).

## When to activate

- User wants to click around the UI: "open the app", "let me try this in the browser", "show me the form", "I want to test this".
- User wants screenshots of a feature.
- User explicitly invokes `/bifrost-debug`.
- Before manually verifying a UI change at the end of a feature (per `bifrost-testing` Definition of Done).

Do **not** activate for backend-only work that can be verified via tests, type generation, or `curl` against a running stack.

## Two boot modes (auto-detected)

`./debug.sh` picks the mode based on whether `NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY` is available in the env (process env, or `~/.config/bifrost/debug.env`):

- **Mode A — netbird:** key present. Stack reachable only via the Netbird mesh at `http://<bifrost-debug-WORKTREE>`. No host port bindings. Suited for showing the user's stack to anyone on their Netbird network (or themselves on a different device).
- **Mode B — port:** no key. Client exposed on a deterministic free host port (30000–39999, hashed from worktree path). Reachable at `http://localhost:<port>`. Default for most local development.

The user picks the mode by setting (or not setting) `NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY` in `~/.config/bifrost/debug.env`. Don't try to switch modes for them.

**Optional in Mode A:** `NETBIRD_EXTRA_DNS_LABELS` in `~/.config/bifrost/debug.env` adds DNS aliases for the peer (comma-separated, e.g. `bifrost,debug-current` → `bifrost.netbird.cloud`, `debug-current.netbird.cloud`). Wildcards work (`*.myserver`). Useful for stable per-user names that don't change with the worktree. Don't set this for the user — they manage it themselves.

## The basic flow

1. **Check status first.** Don't re-boot if already up.

   ```bash
   ./debug.sh status
   ```

   If the output shows `Status:   UP`, parse the `Open:` line and hand the URL straight to the user. Stop.

2. **If down, boot it (backgrounded).** `./debug.sh up` runs `docker compose up -d --build` and then waits up to 180s for the API health check. First boot can take 1-3 minutes for the image build, so use a background shell:

   ```bash
   # Bash(run_in_background=true)
   ./debug.sh up
   ```

   Tail the background output with BashOutput until you see one of:
   - `Open:     http://...` — success. Hand the URL to the user.
   - `ERROR: api did not become ready` — failure. Run `./debug.sh logs api` and report what's wrong.

3. **Tell the user the credentials.** Login is `dev@gobifrost.com` / `password`. MFA is off. No setup wizard. Mention this once with the URL.

4. **Point at logs if they ask.** `./debug.sh logs <service>` — services include `api`, `client`, `worker`, `scheduler`, `postgres`, `rabbitmq`, `redis`, `minio`.

## Auto-connect the CLI in this folder

After `./debug.sh up`, wire the per-folder CLI to target this stack. Tokens for multiple instances coexist in the OS keychain, keyed by URL — the user's prod token (if any) is not affected.

1. Run the standard browser login against the debug URL:

   ```bash
   bifrost login --url <URL_FROM_DEBUG_STATUS>
   ```

   This opens the device-code page, the user accepts, and the token lands in the keychain (or the JSON fallback on headless Linux). On success, `bifrost login` also writes `BIFROST_API_URL=<URL>` to `.env` in the current directory and adds `.env` to `.gitignore` if it isn't already.

2. Tell the user: *"Stack up at <URL>. CLI in this folder is now connected — token is in your keychain alongside any other instances you've logged into."*

On `./debug.sh down`, run:

```bash
bifrost logout --url <URL>
```

That removes the keychain entry and prompts to remove the matching `BIFROST_API_URL` line from `.env`.

### When to use password-grant instead

If the user wants tokens that *don't* persist anywhere — POC folders, throwaway sessions — use the password-grant path:

```bash
bifrost login --url <URL> --email dev@gobifrost.com --password password
```

This prints three `BIFROST_*` lines to stdout and writes nothing to disk. The caller can `eval` them or pipe them into `.env`. Only works on instances with `BIFROST_MFA_ENABLED=false`. Do not suggest this as the default — it exists for the "leave no trace" use case.

## Lifecycle: who tears down what

- **The stack outlives this Claude session.** Closing or clearing the session does NOT tear it down. This is intentional — the user might come back, or have another Claude session attach to the same stack.
- To tear down explicitly: `./debug.sh down`. This removes containers and volumes (postgres data is lost — fine for a debug stack; not fine for the prod stack).
- If the user says "stop the debug stack" or "wipe the debug data," run `./debug.sh down`.
- If a second Claude session or a new conversation comes up while the stack is already running, that's fine — `./debug.sh status` will reveal it. Don't call `./debug.sh up` redundantly; just hand over the URL from `status`.

## Hot reload — don't restart for code changes

Same rule as the dev stack always had:

- API, scheduler, worker: `watchmedo` / uvicorn `--reload` watches `/app/src` and `/app/shared`. Saves cause an automatic restart.
- Client: Vite HMR. Browser updates instantly.

**Never** run `docker compose restart api` (or any service) just because you edited Python. Restart only when:
- New Python dependency in `pyproject.toml` (then rebuild: `docker compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml up -d --build api`).
- New alembic migration (then `docker compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml restart init` to apply, then `restart api`).

Set the user's expectation: "your edit will be live in a few seconds, no restart."

## Multi-worktree

Two worktrees can run debug stacks in parallel. They get different Compose project names (`bifrost-debug-<hash>`), separate volumes, separate ports. To list all running debug stacks:

```bash
docker ps --filter "name=bifrost-debug-" --format "{{.Names}}"
```

Group by project name to find each worktree's URL: `cd <worktree> && ./debug.sh status`.

## Common failures

**API won't come up:**
- `./debug.sh logs init` — migrations failing? Compare `git log origin/main -- api/alembic/versions/` against the worktree.
- `./debug.sh logs api` — usually a config / import error. The traceback is usually in the first 30 lines of output after the start banner.

**Login still shows the setup wizard:**
- The seed-user provisioning runs on every API boot. If the wizard appears, the seed env vars probably aren't loaded — check `docker compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml exec api env | grep BIFROST_DEFAULT_USER`. If empty, `.env.debug` isn't being sourced; investigate `load_env_files` in `debug.sh`.
- "User already exists" on the wizard: a previous (broken) seed user lingers without an org. Run `./debug.sh down` (wipes the DB volume) and `./debug.sh up` again.

**Mode A can't be reached at the hostname:**
- DNS propagation in Netbird takes a few seconds after first peer enrollment. Wait 30s and retry.
- Confirm the peer is registered: `docker compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml logs netbird | tail -20`. Look for `Peer registration completed`.
- The Netbird Admin reverse-proxy mapping needs a one-time setup: peer = the worktree hostname, port = 80. The skill doesn't manage this; the user does it once per worktree (or sets up a wildcard).

**Mode B port not reachable:**
- `./debug.sh status` re-reads the published port from `docker port`. If `Open:` shows nothing, the client container didn't start — `./debug.sh logs client`.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Doesn't manage Netbird account / Admin config (one-time manual setup).
- Doesn't set up `~/.config/bifrost/debug.env` — point the user at it, don't write keys there for them.
- Doesn't run tests. That's the `bifrost-testing` skill's job.
- Doesn't reset DB state. `./debug.sh down` wipes the volume; there's no fast in-place reset (unlike `./test.sh stack reset`).
