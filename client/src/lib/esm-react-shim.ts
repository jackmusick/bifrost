/**
 * Platform globals for app-bundler external resolution.
 *
 * Apps built by the platform's esbuild bundler emit bare specifiers like
 * `import { useState } from "react"`. The static import map in
 * `client/index.html` resolves each bare specifier to a stub URL like
 * `/__bifrost_modules/react.js`. Each stub re-exports from the
 * corresponding `globalThis.__bifrost_*` key — and this function is what
 * populates those keys with the host SPA's already-loaded copies.
 *
 * Must run once at startup, before any dynamic import() of an app bundle.
 * `main.tsx` calls it before any other initialization.
 *
 * Sharing module instances across host and dynamically-loaded bundles
 * avoids the "two Reacts" hooks failure: if a bundle gets a fresh copy
 * of React from a CDN, its useContext call returns null instead of the
 * host's context value because the bundle's React holds different
 * internal context objects.
