 * The platform stores two distinct kinds of access token:
 *
 * 1. The user's normal access token — issued by the login flow, kept in
 *    `localStorage`, shared across all tabs of the same origin.
 *
 * 2. An embed token — minted by `/embed/apps/{slug}` (or `/embed/forms/{id}`)
 *    after a successful HMAC check, scoped to a single application or form
 *    plus a set of `verified_params`, valid for ~8 hours, with no refresh
 *    flow. Embed tokens are kept in `sessionStorage` so they stay isolated
 *    to the iframe / tab that received them and never overwrite the user's
 *    normal session in another tab on the same origin.
 *
 * The embed token is delivered via a URL fragment (`#embed_token=…`) so it
 * never reaches the server in a Referer header or proxy log.
