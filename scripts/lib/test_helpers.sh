# Is the stack for this worktree currently running?
#
# Reads container State columns directly via `--format` rather than relying on
# `--status running --quiet`. The `--status` filter has shown a CI-only race
# (issue #92) where the second `./test.sh` invocation sees no rows immediately
# after the first invocation finished `docker compose up -d --build` — a
# transient daemon state desync, possibly compounded by the buildx builder
# in the GitHub Actions runner.
#
# The fix has two parts:
#   1. Use `ps -a --format '{{.State}}'` and grep for a `running` row. This is
#      a different code path through compose's CLI than the `--status` filter,
#      and empirically does not exhibit the race.
#   2. Retry up to 5×1s on a "no rows seen" result. If the stack is genuinely
#      down (no rows at all) we bail after the second attempt to keep the
#      not-running case fast. Local stacks settle on the first try.
